## Workflow Guidelines

When working on this project, follow these principles.

1. Break down the task into as small as tasks as possible. 
2. Work on each encapsulated task one at a time. 
3. Write the code for the task, then make sure lint and tests pass.

```
make lint
make test
```

If database changes happen and migrations need to occur, run the migration commands:

```
make makemigrations
make migrate
```

4. Then, write unit tests for the task. Make sure lint and tests pass.

```
make lint
make test
```

5. Write a human readable doc for what the code does and what the tests check for review. 

## Rules

1. Do not add comments to code
